What and Why
-Open sourse propgramming language from microsoft
-Type superset of JavaScrpit
-Compiles down to plain JavaScipt
-Relation to Java
-IDE support
-Rapid growth and use
typescript is the main programming language of angular
found it's way to react and vue as well

1. Environment Setup

   1. using command prompt (cmd)
      -tsc main.ts
      create a js file

   -node main
   run main.js file

   2. Adding export or import statement
      Treats the file as a module instead of a script

   export {}

   3. Automatically recomplie typescript file whenever there is a change
      -run the command
      tsc main --watch

   Any changes in main.ts will create a js file with the new code
   -run another command and run main.js
   node main

2. Variable Declarations

   1. let , const

3. Variable Types

   1. boolean, number, string

   2. intellisense, Static type checking
      let total: number = 0;

   3. null , undefined
      let isNew: boolean = null;
      let myName: string = undefined;

   4. array
      let list1: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
      let list2: Array<number> = [1, 2, 3];
      f
      -fixed number
      let person1: [string, number] = ["Chris", 22];

   5. enum
      enum Color {Red = 5, Green, Blue,}
      Green is 6

   6. any
      let randomValue: any = 10;
      randomValue = true;
      randomValue = "Vishwas";

   7. unknwon
      let myVariable: unknown = 10;
      (myVariable as string).toUpperCase(); //type assertion
